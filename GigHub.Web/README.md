# GigHub in ASP.NET Core

First, I would like to thank Mosh Hamedani for his course on PluralSight. 
I watched this course to brush up my C# coding skills after few years working as a project manager / scrum master and I wanted to follow along. 
My personal machine is Linux/Debian and was exploring .Net Core so I thought I will follow along the implementation on the new Asp.Net Core.
